    "          Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) is used to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model by exhaustively searching a predefined hyperparameter space.\n",
    "#### How it works:\n",
    "          It systematically evaluates a model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters in a grid. It uses cross-validation to ensure robustness by splitting the dataset into multiple folds and assessing performance on different subsets, helping prevent overfitting."

    "Use Randomized Search CV when the hyperparameter space is large, and a full grid search would be computationally expensive."
